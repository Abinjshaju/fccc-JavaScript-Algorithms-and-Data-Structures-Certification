This JavaScript function converts a given decimal number to its Roman numeral representation.

The function takes a single parameter, numToConvert, which is the decimal number to be converted to Roman numerals. The function performs the following steps:

1) Two arrays are defined, numbers and roman, which contain the decimal values and corresponding Roman numeral symbols for each of the significant numerals in the Roman numeral system.

2) A variable result is initialized to an empty string. This variable will be used to store the final Roman numeral representation of the input number.

3) A forEach loop is used to iterate over each element in the numbers array. For each element, the loop checks if the input number numToConvert is greater than or equal to the current element. If it is, then the corresponding Roman numeral symbol from the roman array is added to the result string and the numToConvert is subtracted by the corresponding decimal value. This process is repeated until the entire numbers array has been iterated over and the input number has been converted to its Roman numeral representation.

4) The result string is returned as the output of the function.

For example, if the input to the function is 1994, then the function will iterate over the numbers array and add the following Roman numeral symbols to the result string: M, CM, XC, and IV. The final output of the function will be the string 'MCMXCIV', which is the Roman numeral representation of the input number 1994.
