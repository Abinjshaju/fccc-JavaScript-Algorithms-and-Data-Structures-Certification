This JavaScript function is used to check whether a given string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward.

The function takes a single parameter, str, which is the string to be checked for palindrome. The function performs the following steps:

```
str = str.toLowerCase();
```
converts the string to lowercase. This step is done to ignore the case while checking for palindrome, i.e., "Madam" and "madam" should be considered as a palindrome.

```
str = str.replace(/[^a-z0-9]/g, '');
```
removes all non-alphanumeric characters from the string. This step is done to ignore any spaces or punctuation marks in the string while checking for palindrome. The regular expression /[^a-z0-9]/g matches any character that is not an alphabetic or numeric character and the g flag is used to replace all the occurrences of such characters in the string.

```
var backward = str.split(''); backward = backward.reverse().join('').toString();
```

creates a new string backward which is the reverse of the original string str. The split('') function splits the string str into an array of individual characters. The reverse() function reverses the order of the elements in the array, and join('') function joins the elements of the array back into a string, forming the reversed string. Finally, the toString() function is used to convert the reversed string back to a string data type.

```
if(backward === str) {return true;} else {return false;}
```

compares the reversed string backward with the original string str. If both the strings are equal, then the function returns true, indicating that the input string is a palindrome; otherwise, it returns false.

In summary, the function takes a string input, removes non-alphanumeric characters, converts the string to lowercase, and checks whether the resulting string is the same when read backward and forward, returning true if it is a palindrome and false otherwise.
